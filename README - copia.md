# Welcome to the Móncora Project!
> Science clubs for climate change adaptation

## What is the Móncora Project?

Móncora is a citizen science project that aims to form science clubs in schools in Bucaramanga, exposing high school students to scientific research environments and tools at an early age.

This educational project is based on teaching about climate change through the analysis of low-cost weather data stations, with the objective of identifying pollution signals and their correlation with everyday life events.

### Environmental monitoring stations

In each educational institution participating in the project, an environmental monitoring station [**MiniEVA**](https://makesens.co/), will be installed, specially designed to measure particle pollution such as **PM1, PM2.5 y PM10**, but also able to obtain measurements of **temperature**, **pressure** and **relative humidity** of the area where it is located.

With the Móncora project, we will have a network of low-cost monitoring stations, which will provide an alternative for monitoring pollution in the city. During the weekend of March 24 to 27, 2023, we were able to verify the functioning of the stations by confirming the health alert issued by the AMB due to air quality in Bucaramanga:

## How do we carry it out? 


### :one: Preparation

The activities for this stage are:

- Contact educational institutions and invite them to participate in the project. 
- Adjust the hardware and software of the weather stations in the schools, calibrate them, and install them.
- Link the miniEva weather stations of the schools to the new EVA platform/repository.
- Carry out an internal call for the formation of science clubs in schools in Bucaramanga and the metropolitan area. Each science club must consist of at least 1 teacher and 5 students from grades 9, 10, and 11, with whom they must work for 2 to 4 hours per week.
- Develop the work plan of the science clubs and the contents of the weekly sessions.
- Update the project's website, populated with the contents of the science clubs' work plan: [Website](https://class.redclara.net/halley/moncora/intro.html).

### :two: Training

Once the seed groups in schools have been formed, a training stage will begin for students in identifying environmental phenomena related to climate variables. These training sessions will be conducted by members of the Halley UIS Group. This process is divided into four modules:
- Module 1: Citizen Science and Introduction to Climate Change
- Module 2: Introduction to Environmental Monitoring Equipment
- Module 3: Introduction to Python
- Module 4: Data Processing

### :three: Practice
Once the research seed groups have the ability to work with the data from the meteorological stations, research projects will be carried out where students apply the scientific method and the knowledge acquired.

### :four: Science Communication

We will conclude with a **Science Fair** in which all the seed groups share the results obtained in the development of their projects with the local community.
